MyBuild Project

Front and back-end system developed for the final year project of my Software Engineering degree at MMU.

Front-end website developed using HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX

Back-end MVC structure coded in Java, including a REST controller and a suite of Hibernate utilities I developed during the year; linking to a MySQL database.

The system is a prototype designed for people who want to build their own PCs.  Users can select components which are suggested to them based a selection of uses (general, gaming and workstation) and budgets (low, medium, high) and on compatibility with other components; starting with the CPU, then motherboard, cooler, RAM, GPU, storage, case and power supply.  The USPs are that the components would be sent to the user for them to construct their own system, and an integrated knowledgebase with information on each component type to avoid users having to do time-consuming research on components before buying.
